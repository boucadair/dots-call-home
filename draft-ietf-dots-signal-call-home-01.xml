    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the DOTS signal channel Call Home service,
      which enables a DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a DOTS
      client, and to receive the attack traffic information from the DOTS
      client. The DOTS server in turn uses the attack traffic information to
      identify the compromised devices launching the outgoing DDoS attack and
      takes appropriate mitigation action(s).</t>

      <t>The Call Home service is not specific to the home networks; the
      solution targets any deployment which requires to block DDoS attack
      traffic closer to the source(s) of a DDoS attack.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <section anchor="problem" title="The Problem">
        <t>The DOTS signal channel protocol <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> is used to carry
        information about a network resource or a network (or a part thereof)
        that is under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Such
        information is sent by a DOTS client to one or multiple DOTS servers
        so that appropriate mitigation actions are undertaken on traffic
        deemed suspicious. Various use cases are discussed in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more and more
        prevalent in home networks, and with compute and memory becoming
        cheaper and cheaper, various types of IoT devices become available in
        the consumer market at affordable price. But on the downside, the main
        threat being most of these IoT devices are bought off-the-shelf and
        most manufacturers haven't considered security in the product design.
        IoT devices deployed in home networks can be easily compromised, they
        do not have an easy mechanism to upgrade, and IoT manufactures may
        cease manufacture and/or discontinue patching vulnerabilities on IoT
        devices (Section 5.4 of <xref
        target="I-D.irtf-t2trg-iot-seccons"></xref>). However, these
        vulnerable and compromised devices will continue to be used for a long
        period of time in the home, and the end-user does not know that IoT
        devices in his/her home are compromised. The compromised IoT devices
        are typically used for launching DDoS attacks (Section 3 of <xref
        target="I-D.irtf-t2trg-iot-seccons"></xref>) on victims while the
        owner/administrator of the home network is not aware about such
        misbehaviors. Similar to other DDoS attacks, the victim in this attack
        can be an application server, a host, a router, a firewall, or an
        entire network.</t>

        <t>Nowadays, network devices in a home network offer network security
        (e.g., firewall or Intrusion Protection System (IPS) service on a home
        router) to protect the devices connected to the home network from both
        external and internal attacks. Over the years several techniques have
        been identified to detect DDoS attacks, some of these techniques can
        be enabled on home network devices but most of them are used in the
        Internet Service Provider (ISP)'s network. The ISP offering DDoS
        mitigation service can detect outgoing DDoS attack traffic originating
        from its subscribers or the ISP may receive filtering rules (e.g.,
        using BGP flowspec <xref target="RFC5575"></xref>) from a downstream
        service provider to filter, block, or rate-limit DDoS attack traffic
        originating from the ISP's subscribers to a downstream target.</t>

        <t>Some of the DDoS attacks like spoofed RST or FIN packets,
        Slowloris, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) re-negotiation are
        difficult to detect on a home network device without adversely
        affecting its performance. The reason is typically home devices such
        as home routers have fast path to boost the throughput. For every new
        TCP/UDP flow, only the first few packets are punted through the slow
        path. Hence, it is not possible to detect various DDoS attacks in the
        slow path, since the attack payload is sent to the target server after
        the flow is switched to fast path. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of all
        the packets of a flow would be able to detect some of the attacks.
        However, a full-fledged DPI to detect these type of DDoS attacks is
        functionally or operationally not possible for all the devices
        attached to the home network owing to the memory and CPU limitations
        of the home routers. Further, for certain DDoS attacks the ability to
        distinguish legitimate traffic from attacker traffic on a per packet
        basis is complex. This complexity is due to that the packet itself may
        look "legitimate" and no attack signature can be identified. The
        anomaly can be identified only after detailed statistical
        analysis.</t>

        <t>The ISP on the other hand can detect some DDoS attacks originating
        from a home network (Section 2.6 of <xref target="RFC8517"></xref>),
        but the ISP does not have a mechanism to detect which device in the
        home network is generating the DDoS attack traffic. The primary reason
        being that devices in an IPv4 home network are typically behind a
        Network Address Translation (NAT) border. Even in case of a IPv6 home
        network, although the ISP can identify the infected device in the home
        network launching the DDoS traffic by tracking its unique IPv6
        address, the infected device can easily change its IPv6 address to
        evade remediation.</t>

        <t>Existing approaches are still suffering from misused access network
        resources by abusing devices; the support of means for blocking such
        attacks close to the sources are missing. In particular, the DOTS
        signal protocol does not discuss cooperative DDoS mitigation between
        the network hosting an attack source and the ISP to the suppress the
        outbound DDoS attack traffic originating from that network.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sol" title="The Solution">
        <t>This specification addresses the problems discussed in <xref
        target="problem"></xref> and presents the DOTS signal channel Call
        Home extension, which enables the DOTS server to initiate a secure
        connection to the DOTS client, and the DOTS client then conveys the
        attack traffic information to the DOTS server.</t>

        <t>A DOTS client relies upon a variety of triggers to invoke the Call
        Home function (e.g., scrubbing the traffic from the attack source,
        receiving an alert from an attack target, a peer DDoS Mitigation
        System (DMS), or a transit provider). The definition of these triggers
        is deployment-specific. It is therefore out of the scope of this
        document to elaborate on how these triggers are made available to a
        DOTS client. </t>

        <t>In a typical deployment scenario, the DOTS server is enabled on a
        Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), which is aligned with recent trends
        to enrich the CPE with advanced security features. Unlike classic DOTS
        deployments <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref>, such DOTS
        server maintains a single DOTS signal channel session for each
        DOTS-capable upstream provisioning domain <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-multihoming"> </xref>.</t>

        <t>For instance, the DOTS server in the home network initiates the
        Call Home in 'idle' time and then subsequently the DOTS client in the
        ISP environment can initiate a mitigation request whenever the ISP
        detects there is an attack from a compromised device in the DOTS
        server domain (i.e., from within the home network).</t>

        <t>The DOTS server uses the DDoS attack traffic information to
        identify the compromised device in its domain that is responsible for
        launching the DDoS attack, notifies eventually a network
        administrator, and takes appropriate mitigation action(s). A
        mitigation action can be to quarantine the compromised device or block
        its traffic to the attack target(s) until the mitigation request is
        withdrawn.</t>

        <t>Other motivations for introducing the Call Home function are
        discussed in Section 1.1 of <xref target="RFC8071"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This document assumes that DOTS servers are provisioned with a way
        to know how to reach the upstream DOTS client(s), which could occur by
        a variety of means (e.g., <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-server-discovery"></xref>). The specification of
        such means are out of scope of this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability Scope">
        <t>The aforementioned problems may be encountered in other deployments
        than those discussed in <xref target="problem"></xref> (e.g., data
        centers, enterprise networks). The solution specified in this document
        can be used for those deployments to block DDoS attack traffic closer
        to the source(s) of the attack. The Call Home reference architecture
        is shown in <xref target="pb"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="DOTS Signal Channel Call Home">
      <section title="Procedure">
        <t>The DOTS signal channel Call Home extension preserves all but one
        of the DOTS client/server roles in the DOTS protocol stack, as
        compared to DOTS client-initiated DOTS signal channel protocol <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>. The role reversal that
        occurs are at the (D)TLS layer; that is, (1) the DOTS server acts as a
        DTLS client and the DOTS client acts as a DTLS server or (2) the DOTS
        server acts as a TLS client initiating the underlying TCP connection
        and the DOTS client acts as a TLS server. The DOTS server initiates
        (D)TLS handshake to the DOTS client. </t>

        <t>For example, a home network element (e.g., home router) co-located
        with a DOTS server (likely, a client-domain DOTS gateway) is the
        (D)TLS server. However, when calling home, the DOTS server initially
        assumes the role of the (D)TLS client, but the network element's role
        as a DOTS server remains the same. Furthermore, existing certificate
        chains and mutual authentication mechanisms between the DOTS agents
        are unaffected by the Call Home function. This Call Home function
        enables the DOTS server co-located with a network element (possibly
        behind NATs and firewalls) reachable by only the intended DOTS client
        and hence the DOTS server cannot be subjected to DDoS attacks. </t>

        <t>The DOTS signal channel Call Home procedure is as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>If UDP transport is used, the DOTS server begins by initiating
            a DTLS connection to the DOTS client. The DOTS client MUST support
            accepting DTLS connection on the IANA-assigned port number defined
            in <xref target="port"></xref>, but MAY be configured to listen to
            a different port number. <vspace blankLines="1" />If TCP is used,
            the DOTS server begins by initiating a TCP connection to the DOTS
            client. The DOTS client MUST support accepting TCP connections on
            the IANA-assigned port number defined in <xref
            target="port"></xref>, but MAY be configured to listen to a
            different port number. Using this TCP connection, the DOTS server
            initiates a TLS connection to the DOTS client. <vspace

            4.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> can be
            used for initiating (D)TLS connections.</t>

            <t>Using this (D)TLS connection, the DOTS client may request,

          to convey the attacker source prefixes and source port numbers. The

          the mitigation request:<list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="source-prefix:">A list of attacker prefixes used to

              (resp. 128) for IPv4 (resp. IPv6).<vspace blankLines="1" />The
              prefix list MUST NOT include broadcast, loopback, or multicast
              addresses. These addresses are considered as invalid values. In

              are within the scope of the DOTS server domain.<vspace

          included in a mitigation request for diagnostic purposes to notify
          the DOTS server domain administrator, but SHOULD NOT be used to
          determine the target IP addresses. Note that 'target-prefix' becomes
          a mandatory attribute in the mitigation request signaling the attack
          information because 'target-uri' and 'target-fqdn' are optional
          attributes and 'alias-name' will not be conveyed in a mitigation
          request.</t>

          <t>In order to help attack source identification by a DOTS server,
          the DOTS client SHOULD include in its mitigation request additional

          discarded by the DOTS server because the external IP address is not
          visible locally to the DOTS server. The DOTS server is only aware of
          the internal IP addresses/prefixes bound to its domain. Thus, the
          DOTS client MUST NOT include the external IP address and/or port
          number identifying the suspect attack source, but MUST include the
          internal IP address and/or port number. To that aim, the DOTS client
          SHOULD rely on mechanisms, such as <xref target="RFC8512"></xref> or
          <xref target="RFC8513"></xref>, to retrieve the internal IP address
          and port number which are mapped to an external IP address and port
          number.</t>

          <t>If a MAP Border Relay <xref target="RFC7597"></xref> or lwAFTR
          <xref target="RFC7596"></xref> is enabled in the provider's domain
          to service its customers, the identification of an attack source
          bound to an IPv4 address/prefix MUST also rely on source port
          numbers because the same IPv4 address is assigned to multiple
          customers. The port information is required to unambiguously
          identify the source of an attack.</t>

          <t>The DOTS server MUST check that the 'source-prefix' is within the
          scope of the DOTS server domain in the Call Home scenario. Note that
          in such scenario, the DOTS server considers, by default, that any
          routeable IP prefix is within the scope of the DOTS client. Invalid
          mitigation requests are handled as per Section 4.4.1 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>.</t>

          <t>If a translator is enabled on the boundaries of the domain
          hosting the DOTS server (a CPE with NAT enabled, typically), the
          DOTS server uses the attack traffic information conveyed in a
          mitigation request to find the internal source IP address of the
          compromised device and blocks the traffic from the compromised
          device traffic to the attack target until the mitigation request is
          withdrawn. Doing so allows to isolate the suspicious device while
          avoiding to disturb other services.</t>

          <t>The DOTS server domain administrator consent MAY be required to
          block the traffic from the compromised device to the attack target.
          An implementation MAY have a configuration knob to block the traffic
          from the compromised device to the attack target with or without
          DOTS server domain administrator consent. If the attack traffic is
          blocked, the DOTS server informs the DOTS client that the attack is
          being mitigated.</t>

          <t>If the attack traffic information is identified by the DOTS
          server or the DOTS server domain administrator as legitimate
          traffic, the mitigation request is rejected, and 4.09 (Conflict) is
          returned to the DOTS client. The conflict-clause (defined in Section
          4.4.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>)
          indicates the cause of the conflict. The following new value is
          defined:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="4:">Mitigation request rejected. This code is
              returned by the DOTS server to indicate the attack traffic has
              been classified as legitimate traffic.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Once the request is validated by the DOTS server, appropriate
          actions are enforced to block the attack traffic within the source
          network. The DOTS client is informed about the progress of the
          attack mitigation following the rules in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>. For example, if the
          DOTS server is embedded in a CPE, it can program the packet
          processor to punt all the traffic from the compromised device to the
          target to slow path. The CPE inspects the punted slow path traffic
          to detect and block the outgoing DDoS attack traffic or quarantine
          the device (e.g., using MAC level filtering) until it is remediated,
          and notifies the CPE administrator about the compromised device.

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document deviates from classic DOTS signal channel usage by
      having the DOTS server initiate the TLS or DTLS connection. DOTS signal
      channel related security considerations discussed in Section 10 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> MUST be considered. DOTS
      agents MUST authenticate each other using (D)TLS before a DOTS signal
      channel session is considered valid.</t>

      <t>An attacker may launch a DoS attack on the DOTS client by having it
      perform computationally expensive operations, before deducing that the
      attacker doesn't possess a valid key. For instance, in TLS 1.3 <xref
      target="RFC8446"></xref>, the ServerHello message contains a Key Share
      value based on an expensive asymmetric key operation for key
      establishment. Common precautions mitigating DoS attacks are
      recommended, such as temporarily blacklisting the source address after a
      set number of unsuccessful authentication attempts.</t>

      <t>DOTS servers may not blindly trust mitigation requests from DOTS
      clients. For example, DOTS servers can use the attack flow information
      in a mitigation request to enable full-fledged packet inspection
      function to inspect all the traffic from the compromised to the target
      or to re-direct the traffic from the compromised device to the target to
      a DDoS mitigation system to scrub the suspicious traffic. DOTS servers
      can also seek the consent of DOTS server domain administrator to block
      the traffic from the compromised device to the target (see <xref
      target="mitigation"></xref>).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>The considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC6973"></xref> were
      taken into account to assess whether the DOTS Call Home extension
      introduces privacy threats.</t>

      <t>Concretely, the protocol does not leak any new information that can
      be used to ease surveillance. In particular, the DOTS server is not
      required to share information that is local to its network (e.g.,
      internal identifiers of an attack source) with the DOTS client.</t>

      <t>The DOTS Call Home extension does not preclude the validation of
      mitigation requests received from a DOTS client. For example, a security
      service running on the CPE may require administrator's consent before
      the CPE acts upon the mitigation request indicated by the DOTS client.
      How the consent is obtained is out of scope of this document.</t>

      <t>Note that a DOTS server can seek for an administrator's consent,
      validate the request by inspecting the traffic, or proceed with
      both.</t>

      <t>The DOTS Call Home extension is only advisory in nature. Concretely,
      the DOTS Call Home extension does not impose any action to be enforced
      within the home network; it is up to the DOTS server (and/or network
      administrator) to decide whether and which actions are required.</t>

      <t>Moreover, the DOTS Call Home extension avoids misattribution by
      appropriately identifying the network to which a suspect attack source
      belongs to (e.g., address sharing issues discussed in <xref
      target="mitigation"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Triggers to send a DOTS mitigation request to a DOTS server are
      deployment-specific. For example, a DOTS client may rely on the output
      of some DDoS detection systems deployed within the DOTS client domain to
      detect potential outbound DDoS attacks or on abuse claims received from
      remote victim networks. Such DDoS detection and mitigation techniques
      are not meant to track the activity of users, but to protect the
      Internet and avoid altering the IP reputation of the DOTS client
      domain.</t>
