      <t>This document specifies the DOTS signal channel Call Home, which
      enables a Call Home DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a
      Call Home DOTS client, and to receive attack traffic information from
      the Call Home DOTS client. The Call Home DOTS server in turn uses the
      attack traffic information to identify compromised devices launching
      outgoing DDoS attacks and take appropriate mitigation action(s).</t>

      <t>The DOTS signal channel Call Home is not specific to home networks;
      the solution targets any deployment in which it is required to block
      DDoS attack traffic closer to the source(s) of a DDoS attack.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <section anchor="problem" title="The Problem">
        <t>The DOTS signal channel protocol <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> is used to carry
        information about a network resource or a network (or a part thereof)
        that is under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack <xref
        target="RFC4732"></xref>. Such information is sent by a DOTS client to
        one or multiple DOTS servers so that appropriate mitigation actions
        are undertaken on traffic deemed suspicious. Various use cases are
        discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more and more
        prevalent, in particular in home networks. With compute and memory
        becoming cheaper and cheaper, various types of IoT devices become
        available in the consumer market at affordable prices. But on the
        downside, there is a corresponding threat since most of these IoT
        devices are bought off-the-shelf and most manufacturers haven't
        considered security in the product design (e.g., <xref
        target="Sec-by-design"></xref>). IoT devices deployed in home networks
        can be easily compromised, they often do not have an easy mechanism to
        upgrade, and even when upgradable, IoT manufacturers may cease
        manufacture and/or discontinue patching vulnerabilities on IoT devices
        (Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of <xref target="RFC8576"></xref>). These
        vulnerable and compromised devices will continue to be used for a long
        period of time in the home, and the end-user does not know that IoT
        devices in his/her home are compromised. The compromised IoT devices
        are typically used for launching DDoS attacks (Section 3 of <xref
        target="RFC8576"></xref>) on victims while the owner/administrator of
        the home network is not aware about such misbehaviors. Similar to
        other DDoS attacks, the victim in this attack can be an application
        server, a host, a router, a firewall, or an entire network. Such
        misbehaviors will have both a collateral damage that affects end
        users, and can harm the reputation of an Internet Service Provider
        (ISP) for being a source of attack traffic.</t>

        <t>Nowadays, network devices in a home network can offer network
        security functions (e.g., firewall <xref target="RFC4949"></xref> or
        Intrusion Protection System (IPS) service <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology"></xref> on a home router) to
        protect the devices connected to the home network from both external
        and internal attacks. It is natural to seek to provide DDoS defense in
        these devices as well, and over the years several techniques have been
        identified to detect DDoS attacks; some of these techniques can be
        enabled on home network devices but most of them are used within the
        ISP's network. The ISP offering a DDoS mitigation service can detect
        outgoing DDoS attack traffic originating from its subscribers or the
        ISP may receive filtering rules (e.g., using BGP Flowspec <xref
        target="RFC5575"></xref><xref
        target="I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6"></xref>) from a downstream service
        provider to filter, block, or rate-limit DDoS attack traffic
        originating from the ISP's subscribers to a downstream target.</t>

        <t>Some of the DDoS attacks like spoofed RST or FIN packets,
        Slowloris, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation are
        difficult to detect on a home network device without adversely
        affecting its performance. The reason is that typically home devices
        such as home routers have fast path to boost the throughput. For every
        new TCP/UDP flow, only the first few packets are punted through the
        slow path. Hence, it is not possible to detect various DDoS attacks in
        the slow path, since the attack payload is sent to the target server
        after the flow is switched to fast path. The reader may refer to
        Section 2 of <xref target="RFC6398"></xref> for a brief definition of
        slow and fast paths.</t>

        <t>Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of all the packets of a flow would be
        able to detect some of the attacks. However, a full-fledged DPI to
        detect these type of DDoS attacks is functionally or operationally not
        possible for all the devices attached to the home network owing to the
        memory and CPU limitations of the home routers. Furthermore, for
        certain DDoS attacks the logic needed to distinguish legitimate
        traffic from attack traffic on a per-packet basis is complex. This
        complexity is due to the fact that the packet itself may look
        "legitimate" and no attack signature can be identified. The anomaly
        can be identified only after detailed statistical analysis.</t>

        <t>ISPs can detect some DDoS attacks originating from a home network
        (e.g., Section 2.6 of <xref target="RFC8517"></xref>), but the ISP
        usually does not have a mechanism to detect which device in the home
        network is generating the DDoS attack traffic. The primary reason for
        this is that devices in an IPv4 home network are typically behind a
        Network Address Translation (NAT) border <xref
        target="RFC2663"></xref>. Even in case of an IPv6 home network,
        although the ISP can identify the infected device in the home network
        launching the DDoS traffic by tracking its unique IPv6 address, the
        infected device can easily change its IPv6 address to evade
        remediation. A security function on the local home network is better
        positioned to track the compromised device across IPv6 address (and
        potentially even MAC address) changes and thus ensure that remediation
        remains in place across such events.</t>

        <t>Existing approaches are still suffering from misused access network
        resources by abusive devices; the support of means for blocking such
        attacks close to the sources are missing. In particular, the DOTS
        signal protocol does not discuss cooperative DDoS mitigation between
        the network hosting an attack source and the ISP to the suppress the
        outbound DDoS attack traffic originating from that network.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sol" title="The Call Home Solution">
        <t>This specification addresses the problems discussed in <xref
        target="problem"></xref> and presents an extension to the DOTS signal
        channel: DOTS signal channel Call Home.</t>

        <t>'DOTS signal channel Call Home' (or DOTS Call Home, for short)
        refers to a DOTS signal channel established at the initiative of a
        DOTS server thanks to a role reversal at the (D)TLS layer (<xref
        target="proc"></xref>). That is, the DOTS server initiates a secure
        connection to a DOTS client, and uses that connection to receive the
        attack traffic information (e.g., attack sources) from the DOTS
        client.</t>

        <t>DOTS agents involved in the DOTS Call Home otherwise adhere to the
        DOTS roles as defined in <xref target="RFC8612"></xref>. For clarity,
        this document uses "Call Home DOTS client" (or "Call Home DOTS
        server") to refer to a DOTS client (or DOTS server) deployed in a Call
        Home scenario (<xref target="fa"></xref>). DOTS Call Home agents may
        (or not) be co-located with DOTS agents that are compliant with <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> (see <xref
        target="coex"></xref> for more details).</t>

        <t>A high-level DOTS Call Home functional architecture is shown in
        <xref target="fa"></xref>. Attack source(s) are within the DOTS server
        domain.</t>

        <t>A Call Home DOTS client relies upon a variety of triggers to make
        use of the Call Home function (e.g., scrubbing the traffic from the
        attack source, receiving an alert from an attack target, a peer DDoS
        Mitigation System (DMS), or a transit provider). The definition of
        these triggers is deployment-specific. It is therefore out of the
        scope of this document to elaborate on how these triggers are made
        available to a Call Home DOTS client.</t>

        <t>In a typical deployment scenario, the Call Home DOTS server is
        enabled on a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), which is aligned with
        recent trends to enrich the CPE with advanced security features.
        Unlike classic DOTS deployments <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref>, such DOTS server maintains a
        single DOTS signal channel session for each DOTS-capable upstream
        provisioning domain <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-multihoming">
        </xref>.</t>

        <t>For instance, the Call Home DOTS server in the home network
        initiates the signal channel Call Home in 'idle' time and then
        subsequently the Call Home DOTS client in the ISP environment can
        initiate a mitigation request whenever the ISP detects there is an
        attack from a compromised device in the DOTS server domain (i.e., from
        within the home network).</t>

        <t>The Call Home DOTS server uses the DDoS attack traffic information
        to identify the compromised device in its domain that is responsible
        for launching the DDoS attack, optionally notifies a network
        administrator, and takes appropriate mitigation action(s). For
        example, a mitigation action can be to quarantine the compromised
        device or block its traffic to the attack target(s) until the
        mitigation request is withdrawn.</t>

        <t>Other motivations for introducing the Call Home function are
        discussed in Section 1.1 of <xref target="RFC8071"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This document assumes that Call Home DOTS servers are provisioned
        with a way to know how to reach the upstream Call Home DOTS client(s),
        which could occur by a variety of means (e.g., <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-server-discovery"></xref>). The specification of
        such means are out of scope of this document.</t>

        channel Call Home is provided in <xref target="as"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="spec" title="DOTS Signal Channel Call Home">
      <section anchor="proc" title="Procedure">
        <t>The DOTS signal channel Call Home preserves all but one of the DOTS
        client/server roles in the DOTS protocol stack, as compared to DOTS
        client-initiated DOTS signal channel protocol <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref>. The role reversal that
        occurs is at the (D)TLS layer; that is, (1) the Call Home DOTS server
        acts as a DTLS client and the Call Home DOTS client acts as a DTLS
        server or (2) the Call Home DOTS server acts as a TLS client
        initiating the underlying TCP connection and the Call Home DOTS client
        acts as a TLS server. The Call Home DOTS server initiates (D)TLS
        handshake to the Call Home DOTS client.</t>

        <t>For example, a home network element (e.g., home router) co-located
        with a Call Home DOTS server is the (D)TLS client. That is, the Call
        Home DOTS server assumes the role of the (D)TLS client, but the
        network element's role as a DOTS server remains the same. </t>

        <t>Existing certificate chains and mutual authentication mechanisms
        between the DOTS agents are unaffected by the Call Home function. From
        a deployment standpoint, and given the scale of Call Home DOTS servers
        that may be involved, enabling means for automating the provisioning
        of credentials on Call Home DOTS servers to authenticate to the Call
        Home DOTS client are encouraged. It is out of the scope of this
        document to elaborate on these means.</t>

        <t>The DOTS signal channel Call Home procedure is as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>If UDP transport is used, the Call Home DOTS server begins by
            initiating a DTLS connection to the Call Home DOTS client.<vspace
            blankLines="1" />If TCP is used, the Call Home DOTS server begins
            by initiating a TCP connection to the Call Home DOTS client. Once
            connected, the Call Home DOTS server continues to initiate a TLS
            connection to the Call Home DOTS client.<vspace
            blankLines="1" />In some cases, peer DOTS agents may have mutual
            agreement to use a specific port number, such as by explicit
            configuration or dynamic discovery <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-dots-server-discovery"></xref>. Absent such
            mutual agreement, the DOTS signal channel Call Home MUST run over
            port number TBD (that is, Call Home DOTS clients must support
            accepting DTLS (or TCP) connections on TBD) as defined in <xref
            target="port"></xref>, for both UDP and TCP. The interaction
            between the base DOTS signal channel and the Call Home is
            discussed in <xref target="app"></xref>.<vspace
            blankLines="1" />The Happy Eyeballs mechanism explained in Section
            4.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> is used
            for initiating (D)TLS connections.</t>

            <t>Using this (D)TLS connection, the Call Home DOTS client may
            request, withdraw, or retrieve the status of mitigation requests.
            The Call Home DOTS client supplies the source information by means

      <section title="DOTS Signal Channel Variations">
        <t></t>

        <section anchor="hb" title="Heartbeat Mechanism">
          <t>Once the (D)TLS section is established between the DOTS agents,
          the Call Home DOTS client contacts the Call Home DOTS server to
          retrieve the session configuration parameters (Section 4.5 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref>). The Call Home DOTS
          server adjusts the 'heartbeat-interval' to accommodate binding
          timers used by on-path NATs and firewalls. Heartbeats will be then
          exchanged by the DOTS agents following the instructions retrieved
          using the signal channel session configuration exchange.</t>

          <t>It is the responsibility of Call Home DOTS servers to ensure that
          on-path translators/firewalls are maintaining a binding so that the
          same external IP address and/or port number is retained for the DOTS
          signal channel session. A Call Home DOTS client MAY trigger their
          heartbeat requests immediately after receiving heartbeat probes from
          its peer Call Home DOTS server.</t>

          <t>When an outgoing attack that saturates the outgoing link from the
          Call Home DOTS server is detected and reported by a Call Home DOTS
          client, the latter MUST continue to use the DOTS signal channel even
          if no traffic is received from the Call Home DOTS server.</t>

          <t>If the Call Home DOTS server receives traffic from the Call Home
          DOTS client, the Call Home DOTS server MUST continue to use the DOTS
          signal channel even if the missing heartbeats allowed threshold
          ('missing-hb-allowed') is reached.</t>

          <t>If the Call Home DOTS server does not receive any traffic from
          the peer Call Home DOTS client during the time span required to
          exhaust the maximum 'missing-hb-allowed' threshold, the Call Home
          DOTS server concludes the session is disconnected. Then, the Call
          Home DOTS server MUST try to establish a new DOTS signal channel
          session, preferably by resuming the (D)TLS session.</t>

        <section title="Redirected Signaling">
          <t>A Call Home DOTS server MUST NOT support the Redirected Signaling
          mechanism as specified in Section 4.6 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> (i.e., a 5.03 response
          that conveys an alternate DOTS server's FQDN or alternate DOTS
          server's IP address(es)). A Call Home DOTS client MUST silently
          discard such message as only a Call Home DOTS server can initiate a
          new (D)TLS connection.</t>

          <t>If a Call Home DOTS client wants to redirect a Call Home DOTS
          server to another Call Home DOTS client, it MUST send a

              target="RFC0792"></xref> and ICMPv6 <xref
              target="RFC4443"></xref> types are supported. Whether ICMP or
              ICMPv6 types are to be used is determined by the address family
              of the 'target-prefix'. <vspace blankLines="1" />This is an
              optional attribute for the base DOTS signal channel
              operations.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The 'source-prefix' parameter is a mandatory attribute when the
          attack traffic information is signaled by a Call Home DOTS client
          (i.e., the Call Home scenario depicted in <xref
          target="signalch"></xref>). 'target-prefix' attribute MUST be
          included in the mitigation request signaling the attack information
          to a Call Home DOTS server. The 'target-uri' or 'target-fqdn'
          parameters can be included in a mitigation request for diagnostic
          purposes to notify the Call Home DOTS server domain administrator,
          but SHOULD NOT be used to determine the target IP addresses.
          'alias-name' is unlikely to be conveyed in a Call Home mitigation
          request given that a target may be any IP resource and that there is
          no incentive for a Call Home DOTS server (embedded, for example, in
          a CPE) to maintain aliases.</t>

          <t>In order to help attack source identification by a Call Home DOTS
          server, the Call Home DOTS client SHOULD include in its mitigation
          request additional information such as 'source-port-range' or
          'source-icmp-type-range' to disambiguate nodes sharing the same
          'source-prefix'. IPv6 addresses/prefixes are sufficient to uniquely
          identify a network endpoint, without need for port numbers or ICMP
          type information. While this is also possible for IPv4, it is much
          less often the case than for IPv6. More address sharing implications
          on the setting of source information ('source-prefix',
          'source-port-range') are discussed in <xref
          target="nat"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Only immediate mitigation requests (i.e., 'trigger-mitigation'
          set to 'true') are allowed; Call Home DOTS clients MUST NOT send
          requests with 'trigger-mitigation' set to 'false'. Such requests
          MUST be discarded by the Call Home DOTS server with a 4.00 (Bad
          Request).</t>

          <t>An example of a mitigation request sent by a Call Home DOTS
          client is shown in <xref target="example"></xref>.<figure

          <t>The Call Home DOTS server MUST check that the 'source-prefix' is
          within the scope of the Call Home DOTS server domain. Note that in a
          DOTS Call Home scenario, the Call Home DOTS server considers, by
          default, that any routeable IP prefix enclosed in 'target-prefix' is
          within the scope of the Call Home DOTS client. Invalid mitigation
          requests are handled as per Section 4.4.1 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref>.<list style="empty">
              <t>Note: These validation checks do not apply when the source
              information is included as a hint in the context of the base
              DOTS signal channel.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The Call Home DOTS server domain administrator consent MAY be
          required to block the traffic from the compromised device to the
          attack target. An implementation MAY have a configuration knob to
          block the traffic from the compromised device to the attack target
          with or without DOTS server domain administrator consent.</t>

          <t>If a consent from the Call Home DOTS server domain administrator
          is required, the Call Home DOTS server replies with 2.01 (Created)
          and 'status' code set to 1 (attack-mitigation-in-progress). Then,
          the mechanisms defined in Section 4.4.2 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> are followed by the DOTS
          agents to update the mitigation status. Particularly, if the attack
          traffic is blocked, the Call Home DOTS server informs the Call Home
          DOTS client that the attack is being mitigated (i.e., by setting the
          'status' code to 2 (attack-successfully-mitigated)).</t>

          <t>If the Call Home DOTS server rejects the mitigation request
          without waiting for a consent from the Call Home DOTS server domain
          administrator, the 'conflict-cause' set to '4' is returned in 4.09
          (Conflict) sent back to the Call Home DOTS client.</t>

          <t>If the attack traffic information is identified by the Call Home
          DOTS server or the Call Home DOTS server domain administrator as
          legitimate traffic, the mitigation request is rejected with a 4.09
          (Conflict) or a notification message with the 'conflict-clause'
          (Section 4.4.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref>)
          set to the following new value:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="4:">Mitigation request rejected. This code is
              returned by the DOTS server to indicate the attack traffic has
              been classified as legitimate traffic.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Once the request is validated by the Call Home DOTS server,
          appropriate actions are enforced to block the attack traffic within
          the source network. For example, if the Call Home DOTS server is
          embedded in a CPE, it can program the packet processor to punt all
          the traffic from the compromised device to the target to slow path.
          The CPE inspects the punted slow path traffic to detect and block
          the outgoing DDoS attack traffic or quarantine the device (e.g.,
          using MAC level filtering) until it is remediated, and notifies the
          CPE administrator about the compromised device. Note that the Call
          Home DOTS client is informed about the progress of the attack
          mitigation following the rules in Section 4.4.2 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The DOTS agents follow the same procedures specified in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> for managing a mitigation
          request.</t>

        <section anchor="nat" title="Address Sharing Considerations">
          <t><xref target="ex1"></xref> depictes an example of a network
          provider that hosts a Call Home DOTS client and deploys a Carrier
          Grade NAT (CGN) between the DOTS client domain and DOTS server
          domain. In such case, communicating an external IP address in a
          mitigation request by a Call Home DOTS client is likely to be
          discarded by the Call Home DOTS server because the external IP
          address is not visible locally to the Call Home DOTS server (<xref
          target="ex1"></xref>). The Call Home DOTS server is only aware of
          the internal IP addresses/prefixes bound to its domain (i.e., those
          used in the Internal Real shown in <xref target="ex1"></xref>).
          Thus, Call Home DOTS clients that are aware of the presence of
          on-path CGNs MUST NOT include the external IP address and/or port
          number identifying the suspect attack source (i.e., those used in
          the External Real shown in <xref target="ex1"></xref>), but MUST
          include the internal IP address and/or port number. To that aim, the
          Call Home DOTS client SHOULD rely on mechanisms, such as <xref
          target="RFC8512"></xref> or <xref target="RFC8513"></xref>, to
          retrieve the internal IP address and port number which are mapped to
          an external IP address and port number. For the particular case of
          NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>, if the target address is an
          IPv4 address, the IPv4-converted IPv6 address of this target address
          <xref target="RFC6052"></xref> SHOULD be used.</t>

          request to find the internal source IP address of the compromised

          the attack target until the mitigation request is withdrawn. The

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document deviates from classic DOTS signal channel usage by
      having the DOTS server initiate the (D)TLS connection. DOTS signal
      channel related security considerations discussed in Section 11 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> MUST be considered. DOTS
      agents MUST authenticate each other using (D)TLS before a DOTS signal
      channel session is considered valid.</t>

      <t>The Call Home function enables a Call Home DOTS server to be
      reachable by only the intended Call Home DOTS client. Appropriate
      filters (e.g., access control lists) can be installed on the Call Home
      DOTS server and network between the Call Home DOTS agents so that only
      communications from a trusted Call Home DOTS client to the Call Home
      DOTS server are allowed.</t>

      <t>An attacker may launch a DoS attack on the DOTS client by having it
      perform computationally expensive operations, before deducing that the
      attacker doesn't possess a valid key. For instance, in TLS 1.3 <xref
      target="RFC8446"></xref>, the ServerHello message contains a Key Share
      value based on an expensive asymmetric key operation for key
      establishment. Common precautions mitigating DoS attacks are
      recommended, such as temporarily adding to a drop-list the source
      address after a set number of unsuccessful authentication attempts.</t>

      <t>The DOTS Call Home can be misused by a misbehaving Call Home DOTS
      client by arbitrarily signalling legitimate traffic as being attack
      traffic or falsifying mitigation signals so that some sources are
      disconnected or some traffic is rate-limited. Such misbehaving Call Home
      DOTS clients may include sources identified by IP addresses that are
      used for internal use only (that is, these addresses are not visible
      outside a Call Home DOTS server domain). Absent explicit policy (e.g.,
      the Call Home DOTS client and server are managed by the same
      administrative entity), such requests should be discarded by the Call
      Home DOTS server. More generally, Call Home DOTS servers should not
      blindly trust mitigation requests from Call Home DOTS clients. For
      example, Call Home DOTS servers could use the attack flow information
      contained in a mitigation request to enable a full-fledged packet
      inspection function to inspect all the traffic from the compromised
      device to the target, or could re-direct the traffic from the
      potentially compromised device to the target towards a DDoS mitigation
      system that can scrub the suspicious traffic, without blindly blocking
      all traffic from the indicated attack source to the target. Call Home
      DOTS servers can also seek the consent of DOTS server domain
      administrator to block the traffic from the potentially compromised
      device to the target (see <xref target="mitigation"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Call Home DOTS agents may interact with on-path address sharing
      functions to retrieve an internal IP addresss/external IP address
      mapping (<xref target="nat"></xref>) identifying an attack source.
      Blocking access or manipulating the mapping information will complicate
      DDoS attack mitigation close to an attack source. Additional security
      considerations are specific to the actual mechanism used to access that
      mapping (refer, e.g., to Section 4 of <xref target="RFC8512"></xref> or
      Section 4 of <xref target="RFC8513"></xref>). </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>The considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC6973"></xref> were
      taken into account to assess whether the DOTS Call Home introduces
      privacy threats.</t>

      <t>Concretely, the protocol does not leak any new information that can
      be used to ease surveillance. In particular, the Call Home DOTS server
      is not required to share information that is local to its network (e.g.,
      internal identifiers of an attack source) with the Call Home DOTS
      client. Also, Call Home DOTS messages carry data that is visible on
      packets sent from within a Call Home DOTS server. Moreover, Call Home
      DOTS clients do not publicly reveal&nbsp;attack identification
      information; that information is only shared with the domain to which
      the IP address/prefix, from which an attack was issued, is assigned.</t>

      <t>The DOTS Call Home does not preclude the validation of mitigation
      requests received from a Call Home DOTS client. For example, a security
      service running on the CPE may require an administrator's consent before
      the CPE acts upon the mitigation request indicated by the Call Home DOTS
      client. How the consent is obtained is out of scope of this
      document.</t>

      <t>Note that a Call Home DOTS server can seek an administrator's
      consent, validate the request by inspecting the relevant traffic for
      attack signatures, or proceed with both courses of action.</t>

      <t>The DOTS Call Home is only advisory in nature. Concretely, the DOTS
      Call Home does not impose any action to be enforced within the network
      hosting an attack source; it is up to the Call Home DOTS server (and/or
      network administrator) to decide whether and which actions are
      required.</t>

      <t>Moreover, the DOTS Call Home avoids misattribution by appropriately
      identifying the network to which a suspect attack source belongs to
      (e.g., address sharing issues discussed in <xref
      target="mitigation"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Triggers to send a DOTS mitigation request to a Call Home DOTS server
      are deployment-specific. For example, a Call Home DOTS client may rely
      on the output of some DDoS detection systems (flow exports or similar
      functions) deployed within the DOTS client domain to detect potential
      outbound DDoS attacks or on abuse claims received from remote victim
      networks. These systems may be misused to track users and infer their
      activities. Such misuses are not required to achieve the functionality
      defined in this document (that is, protect the Internet and avoid
      altering the IP reputation of source networks). It is out of the scope
      to identify privacy threats specific to a given attack detection
      technology. The reader may refer, for example, to Section 11.8 of <xref
      target="RFC7011"></xref>.</t>

             title="Disambiguating Base DOTS Signal vs. DOTS Call Home">
      <t>With the DOTS signal channel Call Home, there is a chance that two
      DOTS agents can simultaneously establish two DOTS signal channels with
      different directions (base DOTS signal channel and DOTS signal channel
      Call Home). Here is one example drawn from the home network.
      Nevertheless, the outcome of the discussion is not specific to these
      networks, but applies to any DOTS Call Home scenario.</t>

      <t>In the Call Home scenario, the DOTS server in, for example, the home
      network can mitigate the DDoS attacks launched by the compromised device
      in its domain by receiving the mitigation request sent by the Call Home
      DOTS client in the ISP environment. In addition, the DOTS client in the
      home network can initiate a mitigation request to the DOTS server in the
      ISP environment to ask for help when the home network is under a DDoS
      attack. Such DOTS server and DOTS client in the home network can
      co-locate in the same home network element (e.g., the Customer Premises
      Equipment). In this case, with the same peer at the same time the home
      network element will have the base DOTS signal channel defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> and the DOTS signal channel
      Call Home defined in this specification. Thus, these two signal channels
      need to be distinguished when they are both supported. Two approaches
      have been considered for distinguishing the two DOTS signal channels,
      but only the one that using the dedicated port number has been chosen as
      the best choice.</t>

      <t>By using a dedicated port number for each, these two signal channels
      can be separated unambiguously and easily. For example, the CPE uses the
      port number 4646 allocated in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis"></xref> to initiate the basic signal
      channel to the ISP when it acts as the DOTS client, and uses the port
      number TBD to initiate the signal channel Call Home. Based on the
      different port numbers, the ISP can directly decide which kind of
      procedures should follow immediately after it receives the DOTS
      messages. This approach just requires two (D)TLS sessions to be
      established respectively for the basic signal channel and signal channel
      Call Home.</t>

      <t>The other approach is signaling the role of each DOTS agent (e.g., by
      using the DOTS data channel as depicted in <xref target="data"></xref>).
      For example, the DOTS agent in the home network first initiates a DOTS
      data channel to the peer DOTS agent in the ISP environment, at this time
      the DOTS agent in the home network is the DOTS client and the peer DOTS
      agent in the ISP environment is the DOTS server. After that, the DOTS
      agent in the home network retrieves the DOTS Call Home capability of the
      peer DOTS agent. If the peer supports the DOTS Call Home, the DOTS agent
      needs to subscribe to the peer to use this extension. Then, the reversal
      of DOTS role can be recognized as done by both DOTS agents. When the
      DOTS agent in the ISP environment, which now is the DOTS client, wants
      to filter the attackers' traffic, it requests the DOTS agent in the home
      network, which now is the DOTS server, for help.</t>

      <t><figure align="center" anchor="data"
          title="Example of DOTS Data Channel Augmentation">
          <artwork><![CDATA[  augment /ietf-data:dots-data/ietf-data:capabilities:
    +--ro call-home-support?   boolean
  augment /ietf-data:dots-data/ietf-data:dots-client:
    +--rw call-home-enable?   boolean
]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>Signaling the role will complicate the DOTS protocols, and this
      complexity is not required in context where the DOTS Call Home is not
      required or only when the DOTS Call Home is needed. Besides, the DOTS
      data channel may not work during attack time. Even if changing the above
      example from using the DOTS data channel to the DOTS signal channel, the
      more procedures will still reduce the efficiency. Using the dedicated
      port number is much easier and more concise compared to the second
      approach, and its cost that establishing two (D)TLS sessions is much
      less. So, using a dedicated port number for the DOTS Call Home is chosen
      in this specification.</t>
